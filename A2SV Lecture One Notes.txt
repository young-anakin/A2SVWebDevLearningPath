A2SV Lecture One Notes
1) In python, empty strings boolean value returns False, and any other form of string returns True
	Eg. Print(bool("")) => returns False
2) In python, modulo won't give a negative number 
	Eg. Print(-1%5)	=> returns 4 
	Explanation: What's the first number less than -1 divisible by 5, which is -5 and the remaining amount between the two is 4
3) Precedence matters in "and" operator. 
	Eg:
	arr = [1,2,3]
	1) if i<3 and arr[i] >0:
	2) if arr[i] >0 and i< 3:
4) if 0<=1<3 is a permissable operator. 			
5) Iterable is anything that could be iterated over. Eg: string, array, dictionary ..etc
6) b = "Hello, World"
	print(b[2:5:-1]) # This returns an empty result because the start is after the end.
